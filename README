This is the README file for TC65SH, a java program for 
communicating with a Siemens/Cinterion TC65 or TC65i 
device. TC65SH can be used on Windows (tested on Windows 7), 
Linux (not tested) and MAC OS (not tested).

Features
===========================================================
 * navigate and list the folder structure in the device
 * upload/download/delete files to/from the device
 * completely erase the device filesystem
 * interactive mode (like a unix shell) 
 * batch mode (for scripting) 
 * remote mode (via telnet) 
  
  
Dependencies
===========================================================
Java SE 6 must be installed on your machine to run TC65SH.
For device communication, tc65sh needs RXTXComm serial port 
implementation. See rxtx.qbang.org for download and 
installation instructions.


Running interactive mode
===========================================================
Extract the binary distribution in a new folder, open a 
command prompt in that folder and run:

  java -cp tc65sh.jar org.tc65sh.Main -p COM1
  
If the name of the serial port is not "COM1" on your 
system, please adjust the portname accordingly.
The given command should connect to the device and
start an interactive session. Type 'help' to get a 
list of available commands.


Running batch mode
===========================================================
TC65SH can read commands from a command file or from an 
command line argument. A command File is specified by the 
'-f' option:
  java -cp tc65sh.jar org.tc65sh.Main -p COM1 -f bla.txt 
Commands can also be specified on the command line, 
use the '-c' option and separate commands by semicolon:
  java -cp tc65sh.jar org.tc65sh.Main -p COM1 -c "mkdir app; cd app; cd aa; put test.txt test.txt"


Running remote mode
===========================================================
TC65SH can read commands from a telnet connection. Start 
TC65SH with the '-t' option:
  java -cp tc65sh.jar org.tc65sh.Main -p COM1 -t 23
Port 23 is the standard telnet port. 
Now open a telnet client and connect to the host
where TC65SH is running. To end the telnet session, simply
close the telnet client. To end the telnet session and make
TC65SH disconnect from the device type 'exit'.


Known Problems
===========================================================
If TC65SH aborts abnormally, the device is left in 
'data mode' and does not answer to AT commands any more.
Solution: Reboot the device (power off and on again)
